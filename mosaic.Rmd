## Overview

This section covers how to make Mosaic plots

We will be using the `alligator` dataset from *vcdExtra* package as a primary dataset to give examples of mosaic plot in this section.

```{r include=False}
head(Alligator)
```
```{r include=False}
str(Alligator)
```


## tl;dr

And here's the code

```{r}
library(vcdExtra)
head(Alligator)

vcd::mosaic(xtabs(count ~ food + lake + size, data = Alligator),
            gp = gpar(fill=c('blue', 'lightblue'))
            )
```

## Simple Example

Mosaic plot can be tricky to read, as such it is useful to see how it was constructed step by step.
Continuting with the alligator dataset.

```{r}
vcd::mosaic(xtabs(count ~ lake, data=Alligator))
vcd::mosaic(xtabs(count ~ lake + food, data=Alligator), )
```



## Mosaic using base R

```{r}
mosaicplot(xtabs(count ~ lake + sex + size + food, data=Alligator), main="")
```

## Theory

## When to use

When you want to see the relationships in Multivariate Categorical Data

## Considerations

- length are easier to judge than area, so try to use rectangle with same width or height
